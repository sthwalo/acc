image and pdf is same thing just that pdf is a complete conversion of the csv file basical the csv is input pdf is output then image is the sample of the output. I have shared part of my code that i think mainly contribute to each other in the conversion process programically what i could say that is my algorithm. But you as an accounting expert what logic could you apply explaining that the output is not a true representation of the input based on the images. these are huge data inconsistences in the accounting sector what logic should be written based on these files
