## **Analysis of Raw PDF Text Extraction**

You're absolutely right! Looking at the raw_pdf_text_output.txt, the Apache PDFBox extraction is working perfectly - it captures the **complete, untruncated transaction descriptions** from the PDF. This confirms that the truncation issue occurs **after extraction, during the parsing and cleaning phase**.

### **Key Evidence from Raw Text:**

1. **Complete Descriptions Preserved:**
   - `"IB TRANSFER TO 300.00- 02 19 27.33 *****2689327 21H53 *****1911"` (Full details)
   - `"IB INSTANT MONEY CASH TO 1,150.00- 02 20 4.59 0736405438 07H59 255773731"` (Complete)
   - `"EXCESS INTEREST 3.99- 02 25 3.40-"` (Already complete)

2. **Table Structure Intact:**
   - Each transaction spans multiple lines with consistent formatting
   - Amounts, dates, and reference numbers are all captured
   - Multi-page layout is preserved

3. **No Truncation at Extraction Level:**
   - The raw text contains all the information that should make it into the database
   - Long descriptions like `"IB PAYMENT TO STONE JEFFR MAPHOSA REIMBURSE"` are fully present

### **Confirmed: Truncation Happens in Parsing**

Since the raw extraction is perfect, the issue is in the **parsing pipeline** that processes this text into structured data for the database. The truncation occurs when:

1. **Text is split into individual transactions** (likely in `BankStatementParsingService.java`)
2. **Descriptions are cleaned/normalized** (string manipulation that cuts off text)
3. **Tabular data is parsed** (column width constraints in `StandardBankTabularParser.java`)

### **Next Steps: Investigate Parsing Logic**
```
// Examine BankStatementParsingService.java
// Look for methods that split the raw text into transaction records
// Likely: parseTransactions() or splitIntoTransactions()

// Look for cleanTransactionDetails() or normalizeDescription() methods
// Check for string operations that might cut off text:
// - substring() with fixed lengths
// - split() operations that discard parts
// - regex replacements that remove content

// Look for column definitions and parsing logic
// Check if there are fixed character limits for description fields
// Look for methods like parseDescription() or extractReference()
