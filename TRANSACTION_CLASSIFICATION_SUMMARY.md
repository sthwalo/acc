# Transaction Classification Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced ChartOfAccountsInitializer.java**:
   - Added `createXGTransactionMappingRules` method to create company-specific transaction mapping rules
   - Added helper methods to create and manage the transaction mapping rules table
   - Updated main method to call the new rule creation method after chart initialization

2. **Created TransactionClassifier.java**:
   - New class to apply mapping rules to unclassified transactions
   - Includes methods to:
     - Load transaction mapping rules from the database
     - Find unclassified transactions
     - Apply rules based on transaction description patterns
     - Update transactions with appropriate account codes

3. **Created Executable Scripts**:
   - `initialize-accounts.sh` - Sets up chart of accounts and transaction mapping rules
   - `classify-transactions.sh` - Applies mapping rules to existing transactions

4. **Added Documentation**:
   - `TRANSACTION_CLASSIFICATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide on how to use the system

## Customized Transaction Mapping Rules

Created custom mapping rules specific to Xinghizana Group's transaction patterns:

- Bank fees → Account 9600
- XG Salaries → Account 8100
- Insurance premiums → Account 8800
- Corobrik income → Account 6000
- Two Way Technologies → Account 8400
- Office rent (Ellispark) → Account 8200
- Director funding (Company Assist) → Account 4000
- And many more...

## System Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Standard chart of accounts is created (account types, categories, accounts)
   - XG-specific transaction mapping rules are created

2. **Classification**:
   - Unclassified transactions are retrieved from the database
   - Each transaction's description is matched against defined patterns
   - Matching transactions are updated with the appropriate account code and name

3. **Reporting**:
   - Classified transactions can now be used for financial reporting
   - Account-based summaries can be generated for analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Classification System**:
   - Run the initialization script to set up accounts and rules
   - Run the classification script to classify existing transactions
   - Verify classifications in the database

2. **Enhance Mapping Rules**:
   - Analyze any remaining unclassified transactions
   - Add additional patterns to improve classification coverage

3. **Integrate with UI**:
   - Add UI components to visualize and manage classification rules
   - Create reports based on classified transactions

## Technical Notes

- The transaction mapping rules are stored in a new table `transaction_mapping_rules`
- Classification is based on simple string pattern matching (LIKE %PATTERN%)
- The system is designed to be run periodically as new transactions are imported
