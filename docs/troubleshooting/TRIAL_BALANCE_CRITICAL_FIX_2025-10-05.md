# CRITICAL: Trial Balance Not Reading from Journal Entries

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issue**: Trial Balance does not balance - showing R 1,167,834.86 difference  
**Root Cause**: Trial Balance reads from `bank_transactions` instead of `journal_entry_lines`  
**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ERROR**

---

## üî¥ Problem Summary

Your Trial Balance shows:
```
TOTALS:     Debit: R 1,167,834.92    Credit: R 0.06
*** TRIAL BALANCE DOES NOT BALANCE ***
Difference: R 1,167,834.86
```

This violates the **fundamental principle of double-entry bookkeeping**: **Debits MUST equal Credits**.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### ‚ùå Current Implementation (WRONG)

**File**: `JdbcFinancialDataRepository.java` (lines 445-452)

```java
private BigDecimal[] getAccountPeriodMovements(int companyId, int fiscalPeriodId, String accountCode) {
    String sql = """
        SELECT
            COALESCE(SUM(debit_amount), 0) as total_debits,
            COALESCE(SUM(credit_amount), 0) as total_credits
        FROM bank_transactions  // ‚ùå WRONG TABLE!
        WHERE company_id = ? AND fiscal_period_id = ? AND account_code = ?
        """;
    // ...
}
```

**Why This Is Wrong**:
1. **Single-Entry Accounting**: `bank_transactions` only captures bank-side movements
2. **Missing Offsetting Entries**: When you pay salaries:
   - Bank transaction shows: DEBIT Bank R34,330.55
   - **MISSING**: CREDIT Employee Costs R34,330.55
3. **Result**: Only bank movements appear, everything else shows zero

## ‚úÖ Actual Data in Database

**Journal Entries ARE Properly Created**:
```sql
SELECT a.account_code, a.account_name,  
       SUM(jel.debit_amount) as total_debits,
       SUM(jel.credit_amount) as total_credits
FROM journal_entry_lines jel
JOIN accounts a ON jel.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.account_code, a.account_name;
```

**Results**:
| Account Code | Account Name | Debits | Credits |
|--------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1100 | Bank - Current Account | R 443,053.92 | R 512,103.68 |
| 2500 | Payroll Liabilities | - | R 35,801.32 |
| 3000 | Accounts Payable | - | R 16,835.00 |
| 4000 | Long-term Loans | - | R 70,200.00 |
| 8100 | Employee Costs | R 534,905.00 | R 324,007.75 |
| 8700 | Professional Services | - | R 500.00 |
| 8800 | Insurance | - | R 16,273.67 |
| 9300 | Training & Development | - | R 2,001.50 |
| 9600 | Bank Charges | - | R 236.00 |

**The data exists! The Trial Balance is just reading from the wrong table.**

## üìö Double-Entry Accounting Fundamentals

### Components of Full Cycle Accounting

You correctly identified these steps:

1. ‚úÖ **Identifying and recording transactions**: Bank statements imported
2. ‚úÖ **Posting journal entries**: Journal entries created (300 lines exist!)
3. ‚ùå **Preparing a trial balance**: **BROKEN** - reads from wrong table
4. ‚è≥ **Adjusting entries**: Not yet implemented
5. ‚è≥ **Preparing financial statements**: Depends on correct trial balance
6. ‚è≥ **Closing entries**: Not yet implemented
7. ‚è≥ **Post-closing trial balance**: Not yet implemented

**Your system is at Step 2.5** - journal entries exist but reports don't use them.

## üîß Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Update Trial Balance Query ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**

**File**: `JdbcFinancialDataRepository.java`

**Current (WRONG)**:
```java
private BigDecimal[] getAccountPeriodMovements(int companyId, int fiscalPeriodId, String accountCode) {
    String sql = """
        SELECT
            COALESCE(SUM(debit_amount), 0) as total_debits,
            COALESCE(SUM(credit_amount), 0) as total_credits
        FROM bank_transactions  // ‚ùå
        WHERE company_id = ? AND fiscal_period_id = ? AND account_code = ?
        """;
}
```

**Fixed (CORRECT)**:
```java
private BigDecimal[] getAccountPeriodMovements(int companyId, int fiscal PeriodId, String accountCode) {
    String sql = """
        SELECT
            COALESCE(SUM(jel.debit_amount), 0) as total_debits,
            COALESCE(SUM(jel.credit_amount), 0) as total_credits
        FROM journal_entry_lines jel
        JOIN accounts a ON jel.account_id = a.id
        JOIN journal_entries je ON jel.journal_entry_id = je.id
        WHERE je.company_id = ? 
          AND je.fiscal_period_id = ? 
          AND a.account_code = ?
        """;
}
```

### Fix 2: Update Opening Balance Query

**Current (WRONG)**:
```java
// Lines 390-402: Uses bank_transactions for previous period closing balance
String balanceSql = """
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(credit_amount), 0) - COALESCE(SUM(debit_amount), 0) as closing_balance
    FROM bank_transactions  // ‚ùå
    WHERE company_id = ? AND fiscal_period_id = ? AND account_code = ?
    """;
```

**Fixed (CORRECT)**:
```java
String balanceSql = """
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(SUM(jel.debit_amount), 0) - COALESCE(SUM(jel.credit_amount), 0) as closing_balance
    FROM journal_entry_lines jel
    JOIN accounts a ON jel.account_id = a.id
    JOIN journal_entries je ON jel.journal_entry_id = je.id
    WHERE je.company_id = ? 
      AND je.fiscal_period_id = ? 
      AND a.account_code = ?
    """;
```

**Note**: Sign convention:
- **Debit balance** (Assets, Expenses): Debit - Credit
- **Credit balance** (Liabilities, Equity, Revenue): Credit - Debit

### Fix 3: Implement Proper Account Type Handling

Trial Balance should respect account types:

```java
private BigDecimal getAccountBalance(String accountCode, BigDecimal debits, BigDecimal credits) {
    // Determine account type from account code
    char firstDigit = accountCode.charAt(0);
    
    switch (firstDigit) {
        case '1': // Assets
        case '8', '9': // Expenses
            return debits.subtract(credits);  // DR balance is positive
            
        case '2': // Liabilities
        case '3': // Equity
        case '4', '5', '6', '7': // Revenue/Income
            return credits.subtract(debits);  // CR balance is positive
            
        default:
            return debits.subtract(credits);
    }
}
```

## üîÑ Full Accounting Cycle Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented:
1. **Transaction Recording**: Bank statement import working
2. **Journal Entry Creation**: 300+ journal entries exist with proper double-entry
3. **General Ledger**: Shows individual account details correctly

### ‚ùå Broken:
1. **Trial Balance**: Reading from wrong table (bank_transactions instead of journal_entry_lines)

### ‚è≥ Not Implemented:
1. **Adjusting Entries**: 
   - Depreciation expense
   - Accrued expenses/revenue
   - Prepaid expenses
   - Unearned revenue
   
2. **Financial Statements**:
   - Income Statement: Needs trial balance
   - Balance Sheet: Needs trial balance
   - Cash Flow Statement: Needs adjustments
   
3. **Closing Entries**:
   - Close revenue accounts to income summary
   - Close expense accounts to income summary
   - Close income summary to retained earnings
   - Close dividends to retained earnings
   
4. **Post-Closing Trial Balance**: Verify permanent accounts only

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Trial Balance (IMMEDIATE) üö®
1. ‚úÖ Update `getAccountPeriodMovements()` to read from `journal_entry_lines`
2. ‚úÖ Update `getAccountOpeningBalance()` to read from `journal_entry_lines`
3. ‚úÖ Test with current data
4. ‚úÖ Verify debits = credits

### Phase 2: Implement Adjusting Entries (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Depreciation module
2. Accruals module (payroll liabilities, accrued expenses)
3. Prepayments & deferrals

### Phase 3: Financial Statements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Income Statement from trial balance
2. Balance Sheet from trial balance
3. Statement of Changes in Equity

### Phase 4: Period Close (LOW PRIORITY)
1. Closing entries automation
2. Post-closing trial balance
3. Period lock functionality

## üí° Key Insights from Your Question

You correctly identified that the system is **NOT following full cycle accounting**. Specifically:

> "I do not these the full cycle is met in this"

**You're absolutely right!** The system has:
- ‚úÖ Steps 1-2: Recording & Posting
- ‚ùå Step 3: Trial Balance (broken)
- ‚ùå Steps 4-7: Not implemented

The menu shows 7 report types, but they're not connected to a proper accounting cycle. The system needs:

1. **Data Integrity**: Fix trial balance to use journal entries
2. **Adjusting Entries**: Implement accrual accounting
3. **Period Close**: Implement closing entry workflow
4. **Opening Balance**: Properly carry forward balances

---

## üîç Testing the Fix

### Before Fix:
```bash
./gradlew run
# Select company ‚Üí Generate Trial Balance
# Result: R 1,167,834.86 difference
```

### After Fix:
```bash
./gradlew run
# Select company ‚Üí Generate Trial Balance
# Result: Debits = Credits (or small rounding difference < R 1.00)
```

### Verification Query:
```sql
-- This should show balanced double-entry
SELECT 
    SUM(debit_amount) as total_debits,
    SUM(credit_amount) as total_credits,
    SUM(debit_amount) - SUM(credit_amount) as difference
FROM journal_entry_lines jel
JOIN journal_entries je ON jel.journal_entry_id = je.id
WHERE je.company_id = 1 AND je.fiscal_period_id = 1;

-- Expected: difference = 0.00
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Problem**: Trial Balance reads from `bank_transactions` (single-entry) instead of `journal_entry_lines` (double-entry)

**Solution**: Update 2 SQL queries in `JdbcFinancialDataRepository.java`

**Impact**: HIGH - Affects all financial reports that depend on trial balance

**Effort**: LOW - 2 query changes, ~30 minutes

**Risk**: LOW - Journal entries already exist and are correct

**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL** - This is fundamental accounting, must be fixed immediately

Your instinct about the accounting cycle was spot-on! This system has good journal entry generation but the reporting layer bypasses it completely.
