## ✅ Verification Results

### 1. File Deletion Verification ✅

**InteractiveCategorizationService.java**:
```bash
$ grep -r "InteractiveCategorizationService" app/src/main/java/ | grep -v ".java:"
# Result: NO OUTPUT (file doesn't exist, no references)
```

**InteractiveTransactionClassifier.java**:
```bash
$ grep -r "InteractiveTransactionClassifier" app/src/main/java/ | grep -v ".java:"
# Result: NO OUTPUT (file doesn't exist, no references)
```

**Status**: ✅ Both files successfully deleted, zero references remaining

---

### 2. Active Service Verification ✅

**InteractiveClassificationService.java**:
```bash
$ ls -lh app/src/main/java/fin/service/Interactive*.java
-rw-r--r--@ 1 sthwalonyoni  staff  71K  InteractiveClassificationService.java
```

**Usage in ApplicationContext.java** (lines 80-81):
```java
InteractiveClassificationService interactiveClassificationService = new InteractiveClassificationService();
register(InteractiveClassificationService.class, interactiveClassificationService);
```

**Status**: ✅ InteractiveClassificationService is the sole remaining service, actively used

---

### 3. Test File Verification ✅

```bash
$ find app/src/test -type f -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "InteractiveCategorizationService\|InteractiveTransactionClassifier" {} \;
# Result: NO OUTPUT (no test references)
```

**Status**: ✅ No test files reference the deleted services
