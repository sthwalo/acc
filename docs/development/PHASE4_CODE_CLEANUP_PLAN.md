# Phase 4: Code Cleanup & Redundancy Removal Plan

**Date**: 3 October 2025  
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Objective**: Remove all redundant services and establish single source of truth

---

## üìã Executive Summary

After achieving 100% SARS compliance in Phase 3, we discovered that **redundant services and duplicate code paths still exist**. This phase will:

1. ‚úÖ Remove duplicate mapping rule services
2. ‚úÖ Remove duplicate chart of accounts services
3. ‚úÖ Delete unused helper methods
4. ‚úÖ Remove dynamic account creation logic
5. ‚úÖ Establish single source of truth for each concern

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (requires refactoring dependencies)

---

## üîç Current Redundancies Identified

### Redundancy 1: TWO Mapping Rule Services

| Service | Status | Used By | Schema Column |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `RuleMappingService` | ‚ùå TO DELETE | TransactionBatchProcessor | `match_value` |
| `TransactionMappingRuleService` | ‚úÖ KEEP | Should be primary | `pattern_text` |

**Problem**: Both use the same database table with conflicting column expectations.

### Redundancy 2: TWO Chart of Accounts Services

| Service | Status | Used By | Account Range |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `ChartOfAccountsService` | ‚ùå TO DELETE | ApplicationContext, AccountService | 4000-6999 (old) |
| `AccountClassificationService` | ‚úÖ KEEP | Primary system | 1000-9999 (SARS) |

**Problem**: Two different initialization methods creating different account structures.

### Redundancy 3: Unused Helper Methods in TransactionMappingService

| Method | Lines | Status | Used By |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| `extractEmployeeName()` | ~12 | ‚ùå UNUSED | None (flagged by compiler) |
| `generateEmployeeCode()` | ~12 | ‚ùå UNUSED | None (flagged by compiler) |
| `extractSupplierName()` | ~35 | ‚ùå UNUSED | None (Phase 3 eliminated usage) |
| `generateSupplierCode()` | ~12 | ‚ùå UNUSED | None (Phase 3 eliminated usage) |

**Total**: ~71 lines to remove

### Redundancy 4: Dynamic Account Creation Method

| Method | Lines | Status | Purpose |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| `getOrCreateDetailedAccount()` | ~15 | ‚ùå TO DELETE | Creates accounts with custom suffixes |
| `createDetailedAccount()` | ~53 | ‚ùå TO DELETE | Database insertion for dynamic accounts |

**Total**: ~68 lines to remove

---

## üéØ Cleanup Tasks

### Task 1: Refactor TransactionBatchProcessor ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/service/TransactionBatchProcessor.java`

**Current Dependency**:
```java
private final RuleMappingService ruleService;

public TransactionBatchProcessor(RuleMappingService ruleService,
                               JournalEntryGenerator journalGenerator) {
    this.ruleService = ruleService;
    this.journalGenerator = journalGenerator;
}
```

**New Dependency**:
```java
private final TransactionMappingRuleService ruleService;

public TransactionBatchProcessor(TransactionMappingRuleService ruleService,
                               JournalEntryGenerator journalGenerator) {
    this.ruleService = ruleService;
    this.journalGenerator = journalGenerator;
}
```

**Changes Required**:
1. Replace `RuleMappingService` import with `TransactionMappingRuleService`
2. Update constructor parameter type
3. Update field type
4. Verify method calls are compatible (both have `loadTransactionMappingRules()`)

**Impact**: LOW - Interface should be compatible

---

### Task 2: Remove ChartOfAccountsService from ApplicationContext ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/context/ApplicationContext.java`

**Lines to Remove**:
```java
ChartOfAccountsService chartOfAccountsService = new ChartOfAccountsService(
    categoryService, accountRepository, transactionMappingRuleService
);
register(ChartOfAccountsService.class, chartOfAccountsService);
```

**Note**: Comment already says it's deprecated - just remove the registration

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Check if AccountService still needs it

---

### Task 3: Refactor AccountService (if needed) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/service/AccountService.java`

**Current Usage**:
```java
private final ChartOfAccountsService chartService;

this.chartService = new ChartOfAccountsService(categoryService, accountService, ruleService);
```

**Analysis Needed**: 
- What does AccountService use ChartOfAccountsService for?
- Can it use AccountClassificationService instead?
- Or should we inject AccountClassificationService?

**Action**: Investigate and refactor if ChartOfAccountsService is actively used

---

### Task 4: Delete 4 Unused Helper Methods ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/service/TransactionMappingService.java`

**Methods to Delete**:

1. **extractEmployeeName()** (lines ~1478-1490)
```java
private String extractEmployeeName(String details) {
    // 12 lines of code
}
```

2. **generateEmployeeCode()** (lines ~1496-1508)
```java
private String generateEmployeeCode(String employeeName) {
    // 12 lines of code
}
```

3. **extractSupplierName()** (lines ~1514-1548)
```java
private String extractSupplierName(String details) {
    // 35 lines of code
}
```

4. **generateSupplierCode()** (lines ~1554-1566)
```java
private String generateSupplierCode(String supplierName) {
    // 12 lines of code
}
```

**Total Lines Removed**: ~71 lines

**Impact**: NONE - Compiler already flagged these as unused

---

### Task 5: Remove Dynamic Account Creation Methods ‚ùå BLOCKED
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/service/TransactionMappingService.java`

**‚ö†Ô∏è DISCOVERY**: These methods are **HEAVILY USED** (35+ calls) and **CANNOT BE DELETED**

**Methods Status**:

1. **getOrCreateDetailedAccount()** (lines ~1190-1210)
   - ‚ùå **CANNOT DELETE** - Called 35+ times in TransactionMappingService
   - Used by: Vehicle tracking, Insurance, Fuel, Bank charges, etc.
   - Status: **KEEP** (essential for current classification logic)

2. **createDetailedAccount()** (lines ~1215-1268)
   - ‚ùå **CANNOT DELETE** - Called by getOrCreateDetailedAccount()
   - Status: **KEEP** (dependency of above)

**Impact**: HIGH - This is a **MAJOR REFACTORING** that was not originally scoped

**Recommendation**: 
- **Phase 4**: Remove only the 4 unused helper methods (safe cleanup)
- **Phase 5 (Future)**: Refactor classification logic to eliminate dynamic accounts
  * Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks
  * Requires: Complete rewrite of mapTransactionToAccount() method
  * Needs: Comprehensive testing strategy

**Updated Task**: Mark as **DEFERRED TO PHASE 5**

---

### Task 6: Delete RuleMappingService.java ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/service/RuleMappingService.java`

**Action**: Delete entire file after Task 1 is complete

**Verification**:
```bash
grep -r "RuleMappingService" app/src/main/java/ | grep -v "RuleMappingService.java"
# Should only show TransactionBatchProcessor (which we'll fix in Task 1)
```

**Impact**: NONE after Task 1 refactoring

---

### Task 7: Delete ChartOfAccountsService.java ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/src/main/java/fin/service/ChartOfAccountsService.java`

**Action**: Delete entire file after Tasks 2 & 3 are complete

**Verification**:
```bash
grep -r "ChartOfAccountsService" app/src/main/java/ | grep -v "ChartOfAccountsService.java"
# Should return NO results
```

**Impact**: NONE after refactoring AccountService (if needed)

---

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: AccountService Dependency
**Risk**: AccountService might actively use ChartOfAccountsService  
**Mitigation**: Analyze before deletion, refactor if needed  
**Rollback**: Keep ChartOfAccountsService if critical dependency found

### Risk 2: Hidden Dynamic Account Creation Calls
**Risk**: Some code might still call getOrCreateDetailedAccount()  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive grep search before deletion  
**Rollback**: Keep methods if usage found, document as technical debt

### Risk 3: TransactionBatchProcessor Method Incompatibility
**Risk**: TransactionMappingRuleService might have different method signatures  
**Mitigation**: Check interface compatibility first  
**Rollback**: Keep RuleMappingService if incompatible
