# Phase 3: Achieve 100% SARS Compliance

**Date**: 3 October 2025  
**Status**: PLANNED  
**Objective**: Complete migration to 100% SARS-compliant account structure

---

## üéØ Phase 3 Objectives

Based on Phase 2 integration test results, we need to:
1. **Migrate remaining 35 transactions (13%)** currently using custom account codes
2. **Classify 13 unclassified transactions** to achieve 100% classification
3. **Remove unused helper methods** (`extractEmployeeName`, `generateEmployeeCode`)
4. **Clean up custom accounts** in database (optional - for housekeeping)

**Target**: 100% SARS compliance (267/267 transactions using standard codes)

---

## üìä Current State (After Phase 2)

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- **254 of 267 transactions classified (95%)**
- **Zero FK violations** (down from 100%)
- **208 transactions (78%)** using standard SARS codes
- **System stable and operational**

### What Needs Work ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **35 transactions (13%)** still use custom codes with suffixes
- **13 transactions (5%)** remain unclassified
- **Some sections** still have dynamic account creation logic

---

## üîß Phase 3 Migration Tasks

### Task 1: Migrate Custom Supplier Accounts (Priority: HIGH)

**Target**: `3000-XXX` (supplier-specific) ‚Üí `2000` (Trade Payables)

**Current Usage**:
```
3000-ANT (Anthony's Tuckshop) - 1 transaction
3000-JEF (Jeffrey Maphosa) - 1 transaction  
3000-DBP (DB Projects) - 1 transaction
3000-GLO (Gloria Mvelase) - 1 transaction
3000-GOO (Goodnews Pty Ltd) - 1 transaction
```

**Implementation**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java
// Lines: ~920-940 (Construction/Transport suppliers)

// OLD CODE (creates dynamic accounts):
if (details.contains("JEFF") || details.contains("JEFFREY")) {
    return getOrCreateDetailedAccount("3000-JEF", "Supplier - JEFFREY MAPHOSA", "3000", "Trade Payables");
}

// NEW CODE (use standard account):
if (details.contains("JEFF") || details.contains("JEFFREY")) {
    return getStandardAccountId("2000"); // Standard Trade Payables
    // Supplier name preserved in transaction 'details' field
}
```

**Benefit**: All supplier payments use ONE account (2000), supplier names stay in transaction details

---

### Task 2: Migrate Custom Construction/Admin Accounts (Priority: HIGH)

**Target**: `8200-XXX` (person-specific) ‚Üí `8900` (Other Operating Expenses)

**Current Usage**:
```
8200-ELL (Elliott Maphosa) - 1 transaction
8200-MOD (Modest Nyoni) - 3 transactions
```

**Implementation**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java
// Lines: ~970-980 (Directors' remuneration section)

// OLD CODE:
if (details.contains("MODEST")) {
    return getOrCreateDetailedAccount("8200-MOD", "Directors' Remuneration - Modest Nyoni", 
                                     "8200", "Rent Expense");
}

// NEW CODE:
if (details.contains("MODEST")) {
    return getStandardAccountId("8900"); // Other Operating Expenses
    // Person name preserved in transaction 'details' field
}
```

**Note**: Could also use `8100` (Employee Costs) if these are salary payments

---

### Task 3: Migrate Remaining Employee-Specific Accounts (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Target**: `8100-XXX` (remaining) ‚Üí `8100` (Employee Costs)

**Current Usage**:
```
8100-999 (General Salary) - 6 transactions
8100-NEO (Neo Entle) - 1 transaction
```

**Status**: **42 transactions already migrated** in Phase 2 ‚úÖ  
**Remaining**: 7 transactions still use custom codes

**Implementation**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java
// Lines: ~795-812 (Salary processing section)

// These sections were partially migrated in Phase 2
// Need to find and migrate remaining `8100-XXX` references
```

---

### Task 4: Migrate Communication Accounts (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Target**: `8400-XXX` (vendor-specific) ‚Üí `8400` (Communication)

**Current Usage**:
```
8400-999 (General Communication) - 1 transaction
8400-TWO (Two Vision IT) - 1 transaction
```

**Implementation**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java
// Lines: ~950-960 (Communication section)

// Already partially migrated in Phase 2 (telephone/mobile ‚Üí 8400)
// Need to migrate remaining vendor-specific codes
```

---

### Task 5: Migrate Admin Expenses (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Target**: `8900-XXX` (vendor-specific) ‚Üí `8900` (Other Operating Expenses)

**Current Usage**:
```
8900-LYC (Lych Design Studio) - 1 transaction
8900-STO (Stone Age Prints) - 1 transaction
8900-003 (General admin) - 1 transaction
```

**Implementation**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java
// Lines: ~890-920 (Other expenses section)

// Similar pattern to other migrations
```

---

### Task 6: Migrate Long-term Liabilities (Priority: LOW)

**Target**: `2000-XXX` (loan-specific) ‚Üí `2400` (Long-term Liabilities)

**Current Usage**:
```
2000-EBS (Ebs Loan) - 1 transaction
2000-EUP (EUP Capital) - 1 transaction
2000-002 (General long-term) - 1 transaction
```

**Implementation**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java
// Lines: ~995-1015 (Loan processing section)

// Map to standard long-term liabilities account
```

---

### Task 7: Fix Inconsistent Sub-Account Codes (Priority: LOW)

**Target**: Migrate remaining sub-accounts to parent accounts

**Current Usage**:
```
3100-002 (VAT Payments) ‚Üí Should be 2100 (Current Tax Payable)
4000-001 (Corobrik Revenue) ‚Üí Should be 4000 (Operating Revenue)
8110-001 (Pension) ‚Üí Should be 8100 (Employee Costs) [DONE in Phase 2 mostly]
1000-006 (Petty Cash) ‚Üí Should be 1000 (Cash & Cash Equivalents)
```

**Implementation**:
```java
// Find specific references in TransactionMappingService.java
// Replace with parent account codes
```

---

### Task 8: Classify Remaining 13 Unclassified Transactions (Priority: HIGH)

**Approach**:
1. **Query unclassified transactions**: Get details of the 13 transactions
2. **Analyze patterns**: Look for common keywords/patterns
3. **Add mapping rules**: Create new rules in database
4. **Test classification**: Run auto-classification again

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    transaction_date,
    details,
    debit_amount,
    credit_amount
FROM bank_transactions
WHERE company_id = 2
  AND (account_code IS NULL OR account_code = '')
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC
LIMIT 13;
```

**Possible Reasons for Unclassified**:
- Unique transaction descriptions not matching any rules
- New vendor/supplier names
- Unusual transaction types
- Manual adjustments needed

---

### Task 9: Remove Unused Helper Methods (Priority: LOW)

**Target**: Clean up methods no longer needed after Phase 2

**Methods to Remove**:
```java
// File: TransactionMappingService.java

// 1. extractEmployeeName(String details)
//    - No longer needed (use standard 8100 account)
//    - Employee names preserved in transaction details

// 2. generateEmployeeCode(String employeeName)
//    - No longer needed (no dynamic employee accounts)

// 3. extractSupplierName(String details)
//    - Review if still needed
//    - May be used elsewhere

// 4. generateSupplierCode(String supplierName)
//    - Review if still needed
//    - May be used elsewhere
```

**Verification**: Use `grep` to check if methods are still called elsewhere

---

## üîç Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```bash
# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "fin.service.TransactionMappingServiceTest"

# Run all tests
./gradlew test
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# 1. Build application
./gradlew clean build -x test

# 2. Run application
./run.sh

# 3. Navigate to classification menu
# Data Management ‚Üí Transaction Classification ‚Üí Auto-Classify Transactions

# 4. Verify results
# - Check classification count
# - Verify no errors
# - Generate reports to validate
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check classification status
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN account_code IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as classified,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN account_code IS NULL THEN 1 END) as unclassified,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN account_code IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as classification_rate
FROM bank_transactions
WHERE company_id = 2;

-- Check for custom account codes
SELECT 
    account_code,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count
FROM bank_transactions
WHERE company_id = 2
  AND account_code IS NOT NULL
  AND (
      account_code LIKE '%-___'  -- Has suffix (e.g., 8100-NEO)
      OR account_code LIKE '%-%'  -- Contains dash
  )
GROUP BY account_code
ORDER BY transaction_count DESC;

-- Should return 0 rows after Phase 3 completion
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### After Phase 3 Completion

**Account Distribution**:
```
Standard SARS Accounts (100%):
- 1000-1999: Current Assets (bank, cash, receivables)
- 2000-2999: Non-Current Assets + Current/Non-Current Liabilities
- 3000-3999: Current Liabilities (payables, accruals, taxes)
- 4000-5999: Revenue (operating revenue, other income)
- 6000-6999: Operating Revenue
- 7000-7999: Other Income (interest, gains, adjustments)
- 8000-8999: Operating Expenses (salaries, rent, utilities, communication)
- 9000-9999: Admin Expenses + Finance Costs (bank charges, interest)
```

**No More**:
- ‚ùå Dynamic employee accounts (8100-XXX)
- ‚ùå Dynamic supplier accounts (3000-XXX)
- ‚ùå Vendor-specific accounts (8400-XXX, 8900-XXX)
- ‚ùå Sub-account codes with suffixes (8310-001, 3100-002)

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ 100% SARS-compliant reporting
- ‚úÖ Simplified account management
- ‚úÖ Standard financial statements
- ‚úÖ Easier auditing and analysis
- ‚úÖ Reduced maintenance burden

## üö® Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Data loss during migration** | LOW | HIGH | Create backups before each change |
| **Incorrect account mapping** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Review each mapping with business logic |
| **Classification rate drops** | LOW | MEDIUM | Test after each migration step |
| **Reports break** | LOW | HIGH | Verify reports after migrations |
| **Performance issues** | VERY LOW | LOW | Optimize queries if needed |

---

## üí° Key Principles

1. **Incremental Migration**: One category at a time
2. **Test Frequently**: After each task, run integration tests
3. **Preserve Data**: Keep all transaction details intact
4. **Document Changes**: Update docs as you go
5. **Review with User**: Get approval before major changes

---

## üìû Decision Points

### Questions to Answer Before Phase 3

1. **Should `8200-XXX` map to `8900` or `8100`?**
   - `8900`: If these are miscellaneous expenses
   - `8100`: If these are salary/remuneration payments
   - **Recommendation**: Review transaction details to decide

2. **Should we create a "Reversals & Adjustments" account (7300)?**
   - Currently using `7200` (Gain on Asset Disposal) as temporary
   - Could create proper account for reversals
   - **Recommendation**: Use `7200` for Phase 3, create `7300` later if needed

3. **What to do with unclassified transactions?**
   - Option A: Add new mapping rules (automated)
   - Option B: Manual classification (user decision)
   - **Recommendation**: Try automated first, manual for exceptions
