## Risk Management & Contingency Planning

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database Migration (Story 1)** - Core company table changes
2. **Transaction Classification (Story 4)** - Core business logic changes  
3. **Historical Data Migration (Story 7)** - Data integrity concerns

### Contingency Plans
1. **Database Rollback:** Keep migration rollback scripts ready
2. **Feature Flags:** Implement toggles to disable new VAT logic if issues arise
3. **Parallel Testing:** Run old and new classification side-by-side for validation
4. **Incremental Migration:** Migrate historical data in batches with validation

### Quality Gates
- **End of Sprint 1:** Foundation working, no regression in existing functionality
