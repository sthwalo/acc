### TASK 3.2: Service Dependency Analysis & Documentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - DEFENSIVE COPYING IMPLEMENTED
**Risk Level:** ‚úÖ LOW
**Files:** All service classes with DI dependencies

#### Problem Description
Service constructors and methods stored mutable object references as part of the Dependency Injection pattern, which were flagged as EI_EXPOSE_REP warnings.

#### Solution Implemented ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Instead of suppressing these warnings as "acceptable architectural decisions," all service classes were updated to use defensive copying patterns, eliminating the need for suppressions entirely.

#### Implementation Steps ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. **Step 3.2.1:** Implement defensive copying in all service constructors ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   ```java
   // Before (exposed internal representation):
   public DataManagementService(String dbUrl, CompanyService companyService) {
       this.companyService = companyService; // EI_EXPOSE_REP warning
   }
   
   // After (defensive copying):
   public DataManagementService(String dbUrl, CompanyService companyService) {
       this.companyService = companyService != null ? new CompanyService(companyService) : null;
   }
   ```

2. **Step 3.2.2:** Update all service getters to use defensive copying ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. **Step 3.2.3:** Add copy constructors to all service classes ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Affected Components ‚úÖ COMPLETED
