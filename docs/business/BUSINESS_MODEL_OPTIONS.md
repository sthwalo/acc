# Alternative License: Business Source License (BSL) Example

## If you want to restrict commercial use, you could use BSL instead:

### Business Source License Benefits:
- ✅ Free for non-commercial use
- ✅ Open source after specific conditions
- ✅ Commercial use requires license fee
- ✅ You retain commercial control

### Example BSL Terms:
- **Use Limitation:** Companies with >$1M annual revenue need commercial license
- **Change Date:** License becomes Apache 2.0 after 4 years
- **Change License:** Apache License 2.0

### Companies Using BSL:
- CockroachDB
- MariaDB MaxScale  
- Elastic Stack (some components)
- MongoDB (some versions)

## Recommendation:

For YOUR financial management system, I recommend **staying with Apache 2.0** because:

1. **Trust Factor** - Financial software needs wide adoption
2. **Enterprise Friendly** - Companies more likely to adopt
3. **Compliance** - Easier for regulated industries
4. **Network Effects** - More users = more opportunities
5. **Industry Standard** - Apache 2.0 is gold standard
